     Call the resolver of the query

     If the Resource type that the query returns is scalar

          send the value returned by the resolver

     else

          instantiate the Resource type and initiate its resolution

     For every field

          If there is a resolver

              call the resolver and get the value

          else

              try to get the value from the rootObject

          If the type is scalar

              assign the returned value to the field

          else

              Instantiate the Resource type of the field and initiate its resolution
